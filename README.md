# Message-Board-Proto-in-PHP

This is a prototype message board where users can send messages to other users.  The system is written in a very easy to follow version of PHP.  Place this software in your /var/www/html/messages directory and you are ready to go with a very cheap version of twitter.

This was written for a friends teenage child, as they wished to augment the messaging of another system.  The system uses flat files as a database.  I copied this from a version that used an SQL database.  It should be failry easy to swith these back and forth.
